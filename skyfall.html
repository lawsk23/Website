                I'm trapped in my conscious

                Hit up the hood pharmacist, he serve all the muddy

                Might shoot at your buddy who shot at my buddy

                The sky keep on fallin', the drugs I keep callin'
                <br>
                They keep pickin' up for me, they love me
                <br>
                I don't wanna buy, oh no, it won't get me high, oh no
                <br>
                I'm trapped in my conscious

                Yea, that's that loud shit, yeah
                <br>
                I been out on my latest trip

                I've been drunk in my latest whip
                <br>
                So I might crash and I asked for it (for real)
                <br>
                Hit the club for the cougars
                <br>
                I never got down with the morals of Martin Luther
                <br>
                I'm just tryna ball, why these niggas want me neutered?
                <br>
                Got her down to her drawers, tryna get a little nuder
                <br>
                They just wanna hang like my nigga Mr. Cooper
                <br>
                I'm so 'head of my time, could I show up any sooner?
                <br>
                They said I fucked the roommates so you know that just a rumor
                <br>
                Have you ever got stoned with your motherfuckin' jeweler?
                <br>
                Scott La Flame, no Rick the Ruler, yeah
